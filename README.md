## Usage 

Please, visit the following git repository that contains a collection of demos that illustrate the usage of this library:

[MMLL-demo](https://github.com/Musketeer-H2020/MMLL-demo)


## Installation using Anaconda (Windows and Linux)

0. Requisites:
  - Conda: https://www.anaconda.com
  - Git client: https://git-scm.com/
  
1. Create conda environment:
```
conda create -n mmll python=3.7 pip
```
2. Activate environment:
```
conda activate mmll
```
3. Install dependencies:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/Musketeer-H2020/MMLL.git
```

## Installation using venv in Linux

Alternatively, you can use Python venv built-in module to create a working environment.

1. Install Python 3.7:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
sudo apt install python3.7
sudo apt-get install python3.7-venv -y
```
2. Update pip:
```
python3.7 -m pip install --upgrade pip
```
3. Create virtual environment in your home folder:
```
cd ~
python3.7 -m venv mmll
```
Please note: "mmll" is the environment name. You can use whatever name you prefer.

4. Activate environment and install auxiliary libraries:
```
source ~/mmll/bin/activate
sudo apt-get install python3.7-dev -y
```
6. Install project library:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/Musketeer-H2020/MMLL.git
```
